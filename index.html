                <p class="caption">Undoubtedly,
                     this current sequence of albums, 
                    as well as the previous ones, is composed of absolutely fantastic songs, 
                    with an impressive variety of rhythms and emotions that are jaw-dropping.</p>
                    <h1>I think our story needs more page</h1><br>
                    <p class="pragraph">Also in 2022 BTS released Proof, an anthology album that included the new single 
                        “Yet to Come (The Most Beautiful Moment).” Shortly afterward the band announced a hiatus,
                         suggesting that they planned to pursue solo projects. A couple of months later, 
                         their label stated that members of the group were enlisting in South Korea’s military,
                          which by law requires all able-bodied men to enroll by the time they reach age 28 to serve
                           for about two years (a bill passed in 2020 allowed pop stars and other cultural icons to delay 
                           conscription until the age of 30). 
                        The announcement said members planned to reconvene in 2025 after completing their service.<br>
                        Beyond multimillions in album sales, concert tickets, 
                        and followers on social media, 
                        a measure of BTS’s immense success and influence is their social outreach work. 
                        The group collaborated with UNICEF to support social programs for children and teens, 
                        and they have addressed the United Nations General Assembly. 
                        In 2022 BTS were invited to the White House to meet with Pres. 
                        Joe Biden about combating the rise of anti-Asian violence in the U.S. Social action is not limited to BTS;
                         legions of K-pop fans used their digital fluency to reserve tickets at a rally for Donald Trump in 2020, 
                        creating low actual attendance, along with other forms of social activism.</p>

            <div class="text-section">
                <p>BTS stands for Bangtan Sonyeondan. It is also known as the Bangtan Boys. 
                    It is a seven-member South Korean boy band formed in 2013 in Seoul. 
                    Bangtan Sonyeondan in Korean means "bulletproof boy scouts."
                    Koreans call them by this name, however people in other countries refer to them as BTS</p>
                    <h1>I've been following them since Persona album</h1>
                    <P>Maybe you’re new in this fandom, taking your first steps towards knowing what BTS has done and built so far, and you’re asking yourself: 
                        “What is this Map of the Soul that they talk about so much? SOS”. Well, “Map of the Soul”,
                         first of all, is the name of the series of albums that the group has been developing since the first half of 2019.
                          We have already been through “Map of the Soul: Persona” (2019), “Map of the Soul : 7” (2020) and, more recently, 
                          “Map of the Soul: 7 ~ The Journey” (2020).</P>
